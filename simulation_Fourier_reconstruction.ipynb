    "**Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier** (1768-1830) was a **french mathematician and physicist** that notably investigated the Fourier Series theorem that states that ***any signal can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoidal sub-signals, each having its own frequency, magnitude and phase***. This property later became one of the most fundamental tool for signal processing, especially in Magnetic Resonance Imaging where this duality between the spatial evolution of a signal and its frequency/magnitude/phase components is the bedrock of the image reconstruction process.\n",

    "- The **non-shifted Fourier Domain**: Ranging from low to high frequencies ($Range: [0, F_s]$, $F_s$ being the sampling frequency of the signal),\n",

These two representations are equivalent, as they relate to the same signal, but they have different utilities. For example, the Fourier domain will come handy when we need to visualize the main frequencies that compose a signal, in order to filter it for example.\n",

    "Gibbs artifacts manifests themselves by the apparition of ripple around high contrast interfaces. \n",

    "As you might have seen in the **Square-signal decomposition interactive animation**, approximating a square signal without enough sinusoids results in the apparition of \"ripples\" at the top of the square signal. In the image domain, having a high intensity region right beside a low intensity region can be assimilated to a square signal and thus requires an infinite number of k-space samples in order to be perfectly reconstructed. As we are limited in the number of samples acquired in the Fourier domain, we might not have enough information to correctly reconstruct this high contrast interface during the inverse Fourier transform process. This is why ripples might appear around highly contrasted regions.\n",
